# statim ('stat·​im) *"immediately"*

Statim is both a language and set of compiler tools built with kernel development in mind.
Overarching priorities are compilation times, metaprogramming abilities, and compile-time
executions. Although costly to the former, having a unique low-level IR interpretable by a VM 
allows for some interesting compiler feedback and compile-time opportunities. 

Some long-term goals include...

* Built-in build system

* Type reflection

* First-class hot reloading for native programs
